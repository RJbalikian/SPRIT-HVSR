      We will undo setp 6 of MUSTANG processing as outlined below:
          1. Dividing the window into 13 segments having 75% overlap
          2. For each segment:
             2.1 Removing the trend and mean
             2.2 Apply a 10% sine taper
             2.3 FFT
          3. Calculate the normalized PSD
          4. Average the 13 PSDs & scale to compensate for tapering
          5. Frequency-smooth the averaged PSD over 1-octave intervals at 1/8-octave increments
          6. Convert power to decibels

    NOTE: PSD is equal to the power divided by the width of the bin
          PSD = P / W
          log(PSD) = Log(P) - log(W)
          log(P) = log(PSD) + log(W)  here W is width in frequency
          log(P) = log(PSD) - log(Wt) here Wt is width in period

    for each bin perform rectangular integration to compute power
    power is assigned to the point at the begining of the interval

     Here we are computing power for individual ponts, so, no integration is necessary, just
